# personalClock

This project is about developing a personal clock with the capabilities of displaying weather information. The software will run on a raspberry pi zero.

In additition, I will try to recreate the alarm mechanism of a wind up clock using gears, springs, and a motor.

### Possible Additions
- Sync with google calendar to display meetings 
- Machine Learning Model to make weather decisions
- Connect with an external server for more features that the Pi Zero can't handle
